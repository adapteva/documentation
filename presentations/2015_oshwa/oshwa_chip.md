## Kickstarting Parallel Computing
* Parallella: "The $99 supercomputer"
* 18 CPU cores on a credit card and @ 5W 
* Democratizes access to parallel computing
* $898K raised on Kickstarter in Oct 2012
* Now generally available at Amazon, Digi-Key, RS
* Over 10,000 shipped  
* Open source hardware

## Status Quo Chip Design Costs  
   
   "A System On Chip costs $100M to develop" --industry pundit  

| Metric            | Cost     |  
| -------------     |--------- |
| Engineering       | $150K/eng|
| IP Licensing      | $1-10M   |
| EDA Tools         | $1-10M   |
| Tapeout           | $2M      |
| Chip packaging    | $50K     |

## Endless Possibilities for Custom Chips
* Health (diagnostics & embedded devices)   
* Robotics (wicked smaat)  
* Communication (free and pervasive)   
* Supercomputers (to answer really tough questions)
