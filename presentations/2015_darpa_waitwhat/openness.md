## Adapteva History
- 2008: Semiconductor company founded in Lexington, MA
- 2010: 16-core 65nm processor (25GFLOPS/W)
- 2011: 64-core 28nm processor (50GFLOPS/W)
- Accomplished with 3 engineers and $5M
 
## But it wasn't enough!

## Startup Challenges
* Skepticism: "If it was possible, Intel would have done it"  
* Competition: David vs Goliath and best out of 7!
* Amdahl: Not everything can be improved by 10-100x  
* Leverage: When you are small, EVERYTHING costs $$  
* Time: Engagement mismatch. Weeks, months, years.

## My 2012 "Epiphany"

1. Pricing and paranoia was killing us!
2. Openness is the "secret" to building platforms
3. Follow the leaders:    
-Arduino & Raspberry Pi --> low price breeds adoption   
-Kickstarter --> capital transparency  
-Linux --> open collaboration leadership  
-ARM --> importance of strong corporate partners

## Kickstarting Parallel Computing
* Parallella: "The $99 supercomputer"
* 18 CPU cores on a credit card and @ 5W 
* Democratizes access to parallel computing
* $898K raised on Kickstarter in Oct 2012
* Open source and open access
* Now generally available at Amazon & Digi-Key
