## Software:
- Trend is 50 year unbroken trend for software to get easier
- The Most engineering efficient solution wins
- Gravity is a dominant force in software development
- Beware of virtuous/evil allieance
- Free as in FREEDOM has lost
- Legacy software is incredibly sticky
- Binary compatibility does matter

## Programmers
- Scarcity of parallel programers
- Everyone wants a different language, library
- Hiring great programmers as a startup is very difficult
- Low level programmers a dying breed
- Programmers specialize at one level (science, algorithmsm, app,libs, firmware)

## Applications
- Surprisingly hard to find killer apps
- Algorithm experts are frenemies
- Software developers are frenemies
- Most algorithm work is tied to certain hardware architetures

## Marketing
- Winning in social marketing is about emotion, not data
- It's about stories, not data
- Pictures beats words every time
- Traffic != Sales
- Unlikely to succeed without greaet marketing & great product
- Social marketing != traditional marketing
- Channel diversity matters
- Ask customers the right question
- Ship prototypes

## Team Building
- Team building takes time, old team has big advantage
- Rresearch from IBM (Brooks) and TI
- Step #1: Hire the best people you have worked with before
- Step #2: Hire based on recommendation at your own risk (need luck)

## Manufacturing
- You can't compete without Tier-1 manufacturing partners
- Building 1/10/100/1000/1M require different infrastructure
- Beware of the valley of death (1,000-->10,000 units)
- National distribution is fairly easy
- International distribution is horrible!
- Building complex <$100 products in US is not recommended (..but we did!)
- Only use standard parts available at Digikey/Mouser
- Always negotiate pricing directly with manufacturer

## Product
- Build solutions, not platforms

## Pricing
- Only go after markets that can sustain 50% gross margin
- Don't go after consumer space
- $25 is the new "$99"

## Partnering/Collaboration Case Studies
  - Magma (Synopsys)
  - BittWare
  - GlobalFoundries
  - Ericsson
  - ARL
  - Evil Corp

## Publishing/Conferences
- Don't do it, big waste of time...
- ...but not a much bigger waste of time than chasing customers...

## Fundraising
- Total ($7.2M) : $200K, $900K (debt), $1.5M, $3.6M, $1M (debt)
- I tried everything (self/grants/kickstarter/angels/ff/VC/corporate)
- I Spent 1,000 hours to close deal with 3 major investors
- New model: Raise small amounts from many people (corp/ind)
- Need lead investor (Bittware, Carmel)
- Total ($7.2M) : $200K, $900K (debt), $1.5M, $3.6M, $1M (debt)

## Architecture
- mesh
- flat memory hierarchy
- multibank
- dual RISC in order
- parallel interfaces
- use of FPGA
- put as much memory as you can

## Financial Management
- Don't expect to retire (spent retirement savings to self fund company)
- Be ready for missed salaries (missed salary 4 times in last 5 years)
- We survived because we managed cash burn better than most

## Parallel Processor Costs
- Table + Exits

## Kickstarter
- Don't do it!
- Show Parallella
- Not the place for science/research
- The "skymall" of modern hardware (show projects)
- Show how we did it

## Community
- Provide free platform support to the community
- Remove obstacles for adoption/contribution
- Community contributions are rare bonuses (Parallella community better than most)
- Open source a must for community building
- Github has been a huge boost to community/company productivity

## Chips
- Ignore the pundits who say chips cost $100M to design
- Ignore designers who say 16nm is exponentially more challenging
- The chip EDA industry is broken
- The chip IP industry is broken
- Building a 10MW Exascale machine in 2017 is trivial
